### Forum with Test Driven Development(TDD)
A forum is a deceptively complex thing. Sure, it's made up of threads and replies, but
what else might exist as part of a forum? What about profiles, or thread
subscriptions, or filtering, or real-time notifications? In this app, I developed a forum
with tests (TDD) from A to Z. I used Laravel With Vue along with some web services
like Algolia and pusher. The app was built with test-driven development using
PHPUnit to write unit and feature tests.
